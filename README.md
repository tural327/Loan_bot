The Weight of Evidence (WoE) and the Information Value (IV) are two of the most widely used tools in Finance and credit risk analysis. Not only these tools are extremely relevant for the measurement of predictive power in

 , but also extremely effective in handling outliers, missing values, and categorical data transformation.

In this notebook, we will explore the practical applications of both WoE and IV by utilizing the Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset. Our aim is to demonstrate how these techniques can be used to enhance the predictive accuracy in many binary classification tasks, such as loan approval prediction.

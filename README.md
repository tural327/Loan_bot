 , but also extremely effective in handling outliers, missing values, and categorical data transformation.

In this notebook, we will explore the practical applications of both WoE and IV by utilizing the Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset. Our aim is to demonstrate how these techniques can be used to enhance the predictive accuracy in many binary classification tasks, such as loan approval prediction.
